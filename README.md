# Scorecards for the Global Healthy and Sustainable Cities Indicator Collaboration Study

The code in this repository draws on results from the Global Healthy and Sustainable Cities Indicator Collaboration Study to generate policy 'scorecard' reports.

The respository is ideally located as a subfolder of the study's spatial components repository, located within the [analysis](https://github.com/global-healthy-liveable-cities/global-indicators/tree/main/analysis) folder.

The input data required are described in the global_scorecards.py file; this data may be awaiting publication to be made public, and is not located in this nor the spatial repository at this stage:

```
gpkg_hexes = os.path.abspath('../../process/data/output/global_indicators_hex_250m_2021-06-21.gpkg')
csv_city_indicators = os.path.abspath("../../process/data/output/global_indicators_city_2021-06-21.csv")
csv_hex_indicators = os.path.abspath("../../process/data/output/global_indicators_hex_250m_2021-06-21.csv")
csv_thresholds_data = os.path.abspath("data/Global Indicators 2020 - thresholds summary estimates.csv")
xlsx_policy_data = os.path.abspath("data/Policy Figures 1 & 2_23 Dec_numerical.xlsx")
```

Python modules required for running the code include pandas, geopandas, and fpdf2 (for PDF generation).

With the required modules installed and data resources available relative to the project directory in the paths listed above, the scorecards can be generated by running
```
python global_scorecards.py
```

This code identifies required data sources, and extracts key information which is passed to functions in scorecard_functions.py to generate resources, format pages, and output the final PDF layout.
